# Video_Games_Sales

##About the Dataset:
This dataset contains information on video game sales and ratings up to 2016. Alongside fields such as Name, Platform, Year_of_Release, Genre, Publisher, NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, and Global_Sales, we also have additional information:

Critic_score: Aggregate score compiled by Metacritic staff
Critic_count: The number of critics used in calculating the Critic_score
User_score: Score given by Metacritic's subscribers
User_count: Number of users who provided the user_score
Developer: Party responsible for creating the game
Rating: The ESRB ratings


##What I Have Done:
Using this dataset, I have conducted analysis to determine which game categories have higher sales and which platforms have more sales, among other insights. For my analysis, I utilized libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for calculations and data visualization.
